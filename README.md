## [Predicting Heart Disease - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/rgardy7/Predicting-Heart-Disease)  
### **Overview:**  
The primary goal of this project was to build a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within the next ten years. Using a dataset that looks into this, I developed a Logistic Regression model to help with prediciting those that may develop heart disease.  

### **Data Source:**  
The source of this data comes from a dataset on kaggle called [“Logistic regression To predict heart disease”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression/data)  
According to the author of this dataset, the data is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.  
There's 4,238 rows of data with 16 columns.  

### **Tools:**

**Language:** Python  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn  
**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

## [**Spotify Music Data Analysis (2009-2025)**](https://github.com/rgardy7/Spotify-Music-Data-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)  
### **Overview:**  
Conducted data analysis on Spotify's music and uncovered trends in taste in music for the past 15 years. Over the course of time we're starting to see more artists come out and music streaming is the most popular way to listen to your favorite artist and songs. There's also been a wave of content that is becoming shorter as time goes on and wanted to see if that had any affects on the number of song releases over time. Questions I had when diving into the data was, do famous artists always have popular songs? How has song duration changed over time? Does explicit content impact track popularity?  

### **Data Source:**  
The source of this data comes from a dataset on kaggle called ["Spotify Global Music Dataset (2009-2025)"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/spotify-global-music-dataset-20092025)  
There's around 8,500 tracks in the dataset.
