[**Spotify Music Data Analysis (2009-2025)**](https://github.com/rgardy7/Spotify-Music-Data-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)  
**Overview**  
Conducted data analysis on Spotify's music and uncovered trends in taste in music for the past 15 years. Over the course of time we're starting to see more artists come out and music streaming is the most popular way to listen to your favorite artist and songs. There's also been a wave of content that is becoming shorter as time goes on and wanted to see if that had any affects on the number of song releases over time. Questions I had when diving into the data was, do famous artists always have popular songs? How has song duration changed over time? Does explicit content impact track popularity?  

**The Data**  
The source of this data comes from a dataset on kaggle called ["Spotify Global Music Dataset (2009-2025)"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/spotify-global-music-dataset-20092025)  
There's around 8,500 tracks in the dataset.
